## Tuples
Tuples are built-in tuples data structures used to store collections of elements that are indexed, sorted, and immutable. Tuples are comparable to lists, but they are different in that once they are created, they cannot be altered, which makes them ideal for storing information that shouldn't be altered. Tuples are frequently used for data that needs to be accessed quickly, like function arguments, database records, and data from outside sources. They are effective at retrieving elements by index.


## Stacks
A stack is a linear data structure that uses the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, which states that the last thing added to the stack is the first to be removed. Typical stack operations include push, pop, peek, and testing to see if the stack is empty. These operations allow you to add and remove elements from the top of the stack, as well as view the top element without removing it. Stack data structures are commonly utilized in a variety of applications, including expression evaluation, backtracking, and memory management.
